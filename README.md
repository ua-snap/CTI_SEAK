# CTI South East Alaska project
Compute CTI over South East Alaska watersheds.
We tried the Pygeoprocessing approach but it was too early in developement to be used for our purpose.
The method used is the traditionnal Taudem approach built to work with multi processing/linux architecture via Python

TAUDEM Version : V5.3.5

CTI_processing.py : is the main script used for creating the two sets of data required. One CTI with Glacier masked out and another version including the glacier.
